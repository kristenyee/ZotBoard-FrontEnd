### UCI Online Whiteboard

ZotBoard is a web app that allows users to easily sketch and collaborate with one another on a shared whiteboard.

Although we have slowly integrated from virtual classes to in-person classes, we wanted to create an online whiteboard for UCI students who can not physically attend campus or needs to collaborate with other peers online when working on a group project. Like a study room, ZotBoard promotes productivity, communication, and collaboration among UCI students in an online workspace.
