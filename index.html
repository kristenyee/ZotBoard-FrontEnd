            <h2>What is ZotBoard?</h2>
            <p>
                In the midst of the ongoing pandemic and the recent transition of collaboration into a virtual setting,
                ZotBoard fosters an environment for Anteaters to work together as if they are in person. With ZotBoard, you
                can add create reminders and take notes using text boxes or visualize your ideas with the drawing function. 
                We hope that this application will help our fellow Anteaters organize their lives and succeed during their 
                time at UCI :) 
            </p>
